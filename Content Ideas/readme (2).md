## Design Philosophy

The HALM Collective website is designed around the concept "Where time surrenders to intention," creating an immersive, app-like experience that combines ethereal messaging with practical information. The design uses full-viewport sections that snap as users scroll, creating a deliberate, intentional journey through the site.
